# DB from scratch

## Part 1

First part of the blog post.

This project creates a very simple DB implementation:

* Writes `Users` to disk
* Each DB entry is its own file with the id as the prefix e.g. `0.json`
* Each DB entry is a JSON file and structure

## Dependencies

- `rustc 1.80.0-nightly (d2d24e395 2024-05-03)`
